Motivation
----------
``Sphinx-Test-Reports`` was created for an automotive project, which needs to document test results and their used
environment configuration in an human-readable format.
The goal is to provide enough information to be able to setup an identical test environment in 20+ years.

``Sphinx-Test-Reports`` is part of a software bundle, which was designed to fulfill
the parameters of the `ISO 26262 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262>`_ standard
for safety critical software in automotive companies.

Other tools are: `sphinx-needs <http://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
and `tox-envreport <http://tox-envreport.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
